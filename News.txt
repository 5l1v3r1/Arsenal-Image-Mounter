-- What's new, driver version 1.0.1.07 and API library version 1.0.013.001

* MountTool previously crashed on start if any disk drive in the system was
  exclusively locked by another application. This problem has been corrected
  in this version.

* Driver now supports drives larger than 2 TB. This requires Windows Server
  2003 or Windows Vista or later, there is still a 2 TB limit on Windows XP.

* MountTool now shows a "mount options" dialog after image file has been
  selected. This dialog shows different options depending on what kind of
  image file is opened.

* A new feature in the driver enables mounting VHD files from Windows Backup
  that have blank disk signature, even in read-only mode. It is done by
  reporting a random disk signature when Windows reads MBR data from the
  disk. This feature is activated from the "mount options" dialog in
  MountTool, or using an option flag when integrating with the API.

* Driver now supports up to 8 MB transfer size instead of old limit of 64 KB.
  For compatibility with existing proxy service providers, large I/O requests
  are automatically split into several smaller requests if proxy service uses
  smaller buffer size. This could severly degrade performance, so when
  developing proxy service providers, use at least 8 MB buffer size.

* Some users have experienced extremely bad performance on Windows XP. A
  possible reason has been identified and corrected. Please report if such
  problems are still seen!
