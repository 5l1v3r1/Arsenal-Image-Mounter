-- What's new, driver version 1.0.4.013 and API library version 1.0.019

* Write-temporary mode (also known as "write-overlay") is now supported for
  most virtual disk formats mounted through DiscUtils.dll as well as the
  existing support through libewf.dll. The API needed to change somewhat to
  make this possible, so existing application that uses this API likely
  need to modify code that creates new virtual disks.

* The driver now supports emulating removable disk devices that can be
  removed using right-click/eject in for example Disk Management.

* The routine that scans for new disks after creating a new disk device is
  now much faster, more efficient and should have less compatibility
  problems.

* The driver now supports directly mounting an existing "PhysicalDrive"
  object as a new virtual SCSI disk. This makes it possible to emulate a
  full partitionable disk using a USB thumb drive. Useful for example to
  access partitions other than the first one on a USB thumb drive.

* Mounting of images using libewf.dll now supports the new .ex01 formats as
  well as old .e01 formats.

* Included newer version of DiscUtils.dll with some fixes and improvements
  for some virtual disk formats.

-- What's new, API library version 1.0.014

* Disks mounted from ewf images through libewf.dll now use sector size from
  ewf image. Previously, sector size was hard-coded as 512 bytes which
  caused Windows to misread partition table and similar if sector size was
  different from that number.

-- What's new, driver version 1.0.1 and API library version 1.0.013

* MountTool previously crashed on start if any disk drive in the system was
  exclusively locked by another application. This problem has been corrected
  in this version.

* Driver now supports drives larger than 2 TB. This requires Windows Server
  2003 or Windows Vista or later, there is still a 2 TB limit on Windows XP.

* MountTool now shows a "mount options" dialog after image file has been
  selected. This dialog shows different options depending on what kind of
  image file is opened.

* A new feature in the driver enables mounting VHD files from Windows Backup
  that have blank disk signature, even in read-only mode. It is done by
  reporting a random disk signature when Windows reads MBR data from the
  disk. This feature is activated from the "mount options" dialog in
  MountTool, or using an option flag when integrating with the API.

* Driver now supports up to 8 MB transfer size instead of old limit of 64 KB.
  For compatibility with existing proxy service providers, large I/O requests
  are automatically split into several smaller requests if proxy service uses
  smaller buffer size. This could severly degrade performance, so when
  developing proxy service providers, use at least 8 MB buffer size.

* Some users have experienced extremely bad performance on Windows XP. A
  possible reason has been identified and corrected. Please report if such
  problems are still seen!
