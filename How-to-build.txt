How to build user-mode tools and library
----------------------------------------

* Download Visual Studio Express 2012 (it's free, you only need to register
  it after using it 30 days) from
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34673


* After installation it may say VS2012 is not compatible with this version
  of Windows. Install the update: KB2781514 from
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36020. 


* Install PowerShell 3.0 from
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595


* Download Arsenal-Image-Mounter from
  https://github.com/ArsenalRecon/Arsenal-Image-Mounter (there's a link to
  'Download ZIP' at the right), and unpack it:
  https://github.com/ArsenalRecon/Arsenal-Image-Mounter/archive/master.zip


* Start Visual Studio Express 2012 and open the Visual Studio Solutions file
  in the UserMode directory called ArsenalImageMounter.sln.


* Now you can go to the Build Menu in the main screen of Visual Studio, and
  click 'Build Project'. That's it. If successful, the binaries are placed
  in the UserMode\*\bin\Release\ folders.


* Install the driver with the ArsenalImageMounter-DriverSetup.exe utility
  (in the DriverSetup folder). Finally, if you want to use libewf.dll, copy
  the libewf.dll, msvcr100.dll and zlib.dll files from the MountTool
  subdirectory in the root to the same directory as the exe file where you
  are about to use libewf.dll.
