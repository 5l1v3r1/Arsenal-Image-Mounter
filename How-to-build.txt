How to build user-mode tools and library
----------------------------------------

* Required: Visual Studio 2010-2015. You can download free versions of
  Visual Studio Express:
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34673


* Install PowerShell 3.0 from
  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595


* Download Arsenal-Image-Mounter from
  https://github.com/ArsenalRecon/Arsenal-Image-Mounter (there's a link to
  'Download ZIP' at the right), and unpack it:
  https://github.com/ArsenalRecon/Arsenal-Image-Mounter/archive/master.zip


* Start Visual Studio and open the solution .sln files in "Native Source" or
  ".NET Source" directories.


* The driver project requires Windows Driver Kit.
  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff557573.aspx
  If you don't need to build the driver project, you can simply exclude that
  project from the build process or from the solution.


* Now you can go to the Build Menu in the main screen of Visual Studio, and
  click 'Build Project'. If successful, the binaries are placed
  in the Source\*\bin\Release\ folders.


* Install the driver with the ArsenalImageMounter-DriverSetup.exe utility
  (in the DriverSetup folder). Finally, if you want to use libewf.dll, copy
  the libewf.dll, msvcr100.dll and zlib.dll files from the libewf subdirectory
  in the root to the same directory as the exe file where you are about to use
  libewf.dll.
