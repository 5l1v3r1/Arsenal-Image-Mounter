User mode components need DiscUtils.dll and libewf.dll in order to mount
certain virtual disk image file formats.

DiscUtils.dll
-------------
DiscUtils.dll is a .NET managed DLL that is used to access several kinds of
virtual disk image files, such as VHD, VDI, VMDK. DiscUtils.dll is references
by Arsenal.ImageMounter.Devio project. The DLL file is expected to be found in
the UserMode\Arsenal.ImageMounter.Devio\DLL subdirectory.

Sources, as well as most recent binary version of DiscUtils.dll, can be
downloaded from DiscUtils project website:
http://discutils.codeplex.com

libewf.dll
----------
libewf.dll is a native, unmanaged, DLL that is dynamically linked by
Arsenal.ImageMounter.Devio when needed. It is primarily needed to mount EnCase
style forensic image files. Arsenal Image Mounter works without this DLL file,
but then without possibility to mount such image files. Because this is an
umanaged DLL file, it needs to be located in either the same directory as the
EXE file or in any other directory referenced in the system PATH environment
variable. It also needs to be built for the correct machine architecture, for
example x86 or amd64.

libewf.dll sources can be downloaded from libewf project website:
http://code.google.com/p/libewf/

There is also a 7-zip archive with DLL binaries for each of the x86, amd64 and
ia64 architectures in the UserMode\Arsenal.ImageMounter.Devio\DLL subdirectory.
