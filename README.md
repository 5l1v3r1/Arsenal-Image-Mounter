=====================

Arsenal Imager Mounter is the image mounter/physical disk driver used by Registry Recon to mount forensic images as physical disks.  Arsenal Image Mounter includes a complete virtual SCSI adapter which allows the disks within forensic images to be mounted as physical disks (rather than shares or partitions) on Microsoft Windows, facilitating disk-specific features like access to Volume Shadow Copies, integration with Disk Manager, etc.
